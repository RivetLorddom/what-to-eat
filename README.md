# WHAT TO EAT

## My final python project for CS50P

#### Description:
Whenever hungry and unable to decide what to eat, ask this program for help.
Create a list of dishes that you like (written to file), and let the program decide for you, what the choice for the day is.
Expend your file over time by adding new positions and ensuring you do not end up eating the same thing over and over again!
